- Check that the GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Verify the build is completing successfully in GitHub Actions

### Custom Domain Not Working
- Verify DNS propagation: `dig witherco.xyz`
- Check that the CNAME file exists in the deployed site
- Ensure GitHub Pages settings have the correct custom domain

### Local Build Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear cache if needed: `rm -rf node_modules/.cache`
- Check for environment variables needed for the build
